Hello Peeps!<br>
Just fucked up my silly question (recursive MergeSort!!!!) at DSA LAB FAT EXAM hope you<br> 
dont do it ...<br>
#Reasons:<br>
1)Despite knowing i could use try catch ... i didnt use it .... <br>
2)Got carried away by that BiGGG "C" program question and lost the opportunity to score both!!!! <br>
3)As ive nailed it now(! phew :( ) ) just remember your recursions well peeps and dont commit the mistakes i do <br> 
Look at the scoring question not the challenging one (specially not in FAT LABS !!!!!) <br>
